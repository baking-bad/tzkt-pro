TzKT Pro provides a flexible Pro for accessing detailed Tezos blockchain data and to help developers build more services and applications on top of Tezos.
TzKT Pro is an open-source project, so you can clone and build it and use as a self-hosted service to avoid any risks of using third-party services.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or if need any specific features or endpoints or query parameters, etc.
Any feedback really helps us make TzKT better.
